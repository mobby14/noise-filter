# üìÑ Project Report: Improved Noise Reduction

## 1. Introduction

In modern communication systems, audio clarity is critical for effective transmission of information. However, recorded or transmitted audio often contains unwanted background noise, which can degrade intelligibility and quality. This project, titled **Improved Noise Reduction**, explores methods for mitigating such noise using digital signal processing (DSP) techniques implemented in Python.

The focus is on applying, analyzing, and comparing noise reduction algorithms on audio signals. The project aims to enhance the quality of speech or music signals by suppressing noise while preserving the important content.

## 2. Objectives

- To implement and evaluate classical and modern noise reduction techniques.
- To visualize and compare noisy vs. cleaned audio signals using waveform and spectrogram analysis.
- To quantitatively assess the improvement using metrics like Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR).
- To provide a reproducible workflow in Jupyter Notebook for educational and practical purposes.

## 3. Tools and Libraries

The project is developed using Python and utilizes the following libraries:

- **NumPy**: Numerical computing
- **SciPy**: Signal processing functions
- **LibROSA**: Audio processing and feature extraction
- **Matplotlib**: Visualization
- **IPython/Jupyter**: Interactive notebook environment

## 4. Methodology

### 4.1 Audio Data Loading

Audio files are loaded using LibROSA, which allows for easy manipulation and visualization. Sample audio is selected with known noise characteristics.

### 4.2 Visualization

Initial waveforms and spectrograms are plotted to analyze the noise profile in both time and frequency domains.

### 4.3 Denoising Techniques

Several denoising methods are explored:

- **Spectral Subtraction**: Reduces noise by estimating and subtracting the noise spectrum.
- **Low-pass/Band-pass Filtering**: Removes high-frequency noise while retaining signal components.
- **Wiener Filtering**: Applies statistical filtering to reduce noise adaptively.

### 4.4 Evaluation

Performance is evaluated using:

- **Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR)**: To measure noise reduction effectiveness.
- **Visual Inspection**: Comparing spectrograms before and after denoising.
- (Optional) **Listening Tests**: Subjective evaluation of audio quality.

## 5. Results

- Significant improvement in audio clarity was observed.
- Spectrograms showed a visible reduction in background noise.
- SNR improved by a measurable margin depending on the method applied.
- Filtering techniques preserved the main audio components with minimal distortion.

## 6. Conclusion

This project demonstrates the practical application of signal processing techniques to enhance audio signals. The implemented methods are effective for basic denoising tasks and can be extended to more complex environments. This work lays a foundation for real-time noise reduction in applications like telephony, speech recognition, and audio production.

## 7. Future Work

- Integration of machine learning-based noise suppressors (e.g., DNN, RNNoise)
- Real-time implementation using audio streams
- Extension to multi-channel audio or stereo recordings
- Benchmarking with standard datasets (e.g., CHiME, TIMIT)
