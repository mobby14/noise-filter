# 🎧 Improved Noise Reduction

This project focuses on implementing and evaluating techniques for reducing noise in audio signals using Python. The goal is to enhance audio clarity by applying advanced filtering and signal processing methods.

## 📁 Project Structure

- `improved noise reduction.ipynb` — Jupyter Notebook containing code, explanations, and results.
- `improved-noise-reduction.md` — Markdown version of the notebook (for easier GitHub viewing).

## 🚀 Features

- Import and visualization of audio signals
- Application of denoising techniques (e.g., spectral subtraction, Wiener filtering)
- Signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) improvement analysis
- Plotting of waveforms and spectrograms
- Comparative analysis before and after denoising

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- SciPy
- LibROSA
- Matplotlib
- IPython/Jupyter

## 🧪 How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
